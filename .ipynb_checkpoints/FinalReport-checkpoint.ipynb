    "Using Additive Manufacturing for an assembly requires some method for assembling the various components. Tapping the parts and using sheet metal screws is one such choice. To determine the various hole diameters for different types of sheet metal screws, a diagnostic print was made using the MakerBot Replicator, CubePro, MJP 3500 printers. Using a torque guage when applying the various screws to the diagnostic print resulted in the selection of the best hole diameter for each screw. these hole diameters were then applied to another diagnostic print that provided insight into the wall thickness necessary to support the various screw types. It was determined that the optimial hole diameter was ___ relative to the thread diameter, and the optimal wall thickness was ___ relative to the thread diameter.\n",

    "Identifying the ideal screw hole diameters and wall thicknesses is a necessary problem to solve. By determining what geometries work best, a working standard can be implimented by people intending to use common sheet metal screws in their 3D printed assemblies. To determine these geomoetries, two diagnostic prints are made. An initial print is created with $18$ screw holes arranged in a grid. The $6$ rows of holes will indicate the hole types, all sheet metal screws. The $3$ columns indicate the hole diameter, one each for the maximum, minimum, and nominal diameters.\n",

    "\\section{Implimentation, Diagnostic One}\n",
    "To print on the MakerBot, three types of prints were tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print on the CubePro, two seperate parts that share a 'sidewalk' were made. Both parts share the same number of holes, each with a grid of 9 total with varying sizes. The feet that allow room for the screw heads remain, with both parts square (FIGURE OF PARTS). Since these two parts are printed together, they share a 'sidewalk'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon examination of the finished CubePro diagnostic prints, there are multiple noticable defects present. The base of each part has warped to an extent, leading to a nearly 2 mm height difference (FIGURE OF PART RESTING ON SURFACE). This has no significant impact on the analysis, only serving to reduce the length of 3 holes by 2 mm at most. There are mutiple top surface defects, with excess print material left behind between the holes outside of the hole walls (FIGURE OF HOLE PRINT TOP). Since the desired geometry was still present, the two prints were used for the initial diagnostic analysis.\n",

    "These tables refer to the success or failure of applying the screws. If the screw went all the way in with no issues and met the torque requirements, then the hole is designated a 'pass'. If the screw did not go in all the way or broke, then it is designated a 'fail'. The type of failure is noted as well.\n",
